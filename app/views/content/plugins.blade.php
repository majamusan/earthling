<h1>The advantages of CMS/MVC systems.</h1>
<h2>Plugins and themes for content managment systems.</h2>
<p>
	Content Management System or CMS is stand-alone web application that lets a novice user easily create, deploy, manage and store content that is displayed on a website. The content can include text, graphics, photos, video, audio and dynamic interactive elements. Content Management in today's world is an important base for any website and is a vital ingredient for such things as blogging, articles, news, description of products etc. Dynamic elements may catalogue and index content, select or assemble content in real time or deliver content to specific visitors in a requested way, such as other languages or targeted content. Web based CMS's allow the content producer and maintainer to be freed from worrying about breaking the design and concentrate on creating great content.

<h2>More bespoke apps with mvc power.</h2>
<p>
<p>
Model–view–controller or MVC is a software design pattern for implementing user interfaces on computers. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user. As with other software architectures, MVC expresses the "core of the solution" to a problem while allowing it to be adapted for each system.
